            This includes the probe, the agent, the CLI and the player.

            Note that this will also disable XDebug as it can conflict with Blackfire probe.

            You won't have to consider the parameters if you already have defined the following environment variables
            in your CirceCI project: BLACKFIRE_SERVER_ID, BLACKFIRE_SERVER_TOKEN, BLACKFIRE_CLIENT_ID, BLACKFIRE_CLIENT_TOKEN.

            If you have set them with different names, you must pass them explicitly as parameters.

        parameters:
            server_id:
                description: Environment variable name in which your server ID is stored.
                type: env_var_name
                default: BLACKFIRE_SERVER_ID
            server_token:
                description: Environment variable name in which your server token is stored.
                type: env_var_name
                default: BLACKFIRE_SERVER_TOKEN
